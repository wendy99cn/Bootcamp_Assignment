AI  is a technolgy that allows machines to stimulate human's behavior of sophiscated cognitive, learing, problem solving. 
By mirror human brains neuron work, the machine can execute similar human behavirs of searching, listening, understanding, decision-making, driving. 
The most popular AI application is Google searching engine, Siri voice recognition, Tesla self-driving system, and Apple face recognize system,etc.

Machine learning is a sub field of AI, it mainly focus on statisctical data processed by computer algorithms, by build model on sample data to make perdictions and decisions.
It also refers to predictive analytics in the real business world.

Supervised learning is one of the approaches of machine learning, the example inputs and desired outputs will be given to the computer, and the computer will acquire the a general
rule maps from the example. The example is known as training example, the algorithms build a mathematical model through training example, the goal is to correctly determine the 
outputs from inputs. There are 3 types of supervised learning algorithms:   active learning, classification and regression.
